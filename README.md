# Firebase
My angular and flutter github repos will use this firebase project


## Instructions

- Run `npm install -g firebase-tools`
- clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/MMHossaini/Firebase.git`
- Replace `<YourPojectId>` in `.firebaserc` with your firebaser project

You can not run `firebase deploy` to deploy your functions, hosting, rules, index

You can create new functions in thesidethe `functions/index.js` file. there is some examples there already
you can place your html files inside public for hosting.

## Help?
